![Fortnite Shop]{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NaviVani-dev/Fortnite-Viewer/refs/heads/main/assets/preview.webp}

A Fortnite Item Shop web made using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript _(also Vite for a live preview)_

This web uses [Fortnite API](https://dash.fortnite-api.com/) to get the latest Item Shop, compatible with every new item (Jam Tracks, Instruments, Decals, etc)

## Why?

This was made as a challenge in my free time to test my skills without using any framework or external package (I didn't use any Vite specific code).  
This was a good refresher, i recommend doing domething like this

## Usage

You can use VS Code extension ["Live Server"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or any other live server tool to preview the webpage without any setup.

Or you can also use Vite if you like:

- Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
// Or use your favorite package manager
yarn
```

- And now you can run Vite

```bash
npm run dev
// or...
yarn dev
```
